# Innova_ML_Presentation

Notes and resources for Machine Learning presentation given on 5/23

# Summary

Problems that are good opportunities for machine learning are typically:
1) Data driven
2) Difficult to codify into rules (i.e. require "intuition")
3) But are tedious for a human to perform

What to look for - these kinds of questions are a tipoff that ML might be applicable to your problem:

* Can we answer this question automatically, based on some data?
* Can we automatically transform some input data into some output?
* Can we automatically associate thing A with thing B?
* Basically, if the question is "can we automatically do ______ based on some data?" then it might be a good candidate for machine learning
    * (Assuming, of course, that you have the data)


## Study Groups / Focus Groups

Please contact either Jacob Eggleston or Jim Kilty if you or any of your team members are interested in learning about ML, contributing to the company's ML POC projects, or simply have machine learning related ideas you would like to run by us.

For those interested in learning more about machine learning, Gradon Faulkner has put together a great set of machine learning overviews and learning resources here: https://machine-learning-resources.gitbook.io/project/. He has grouped the resources into tracks cater to varying levels of interest, commitment, and background experience. It includes everything from high-level infographics on what machine learning is, to guides for solving specific problems using various off-the-shelf ML frameworks, to college-level courses that dive into the nuts and bolts of how machine learning algorithms are implemented.
