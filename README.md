## Study Groups / Focus Groups

Please contact either Jacob Eggleston or Jim Kilty if you or any of your team members are interested in learning about ML, contributing to the company's ML POC projects, or simply have machine learning related ideas you would like to run by us.

For those interested in learning more about machine learning, Gradon Faulkner has put together a great set of machine learning overviews and learning resources here: https://machine-learning-resources.gitbook.io/project/. He has grouped the resources into tracks cater to varying levels of interest, commitment, and background experience. It includes everything from high-level infographics on what machine learning is, to guides for solving specific problems using various off-the-shelf ML frameworks, to college-level courses that dive into the nuts and bolts of how machine learning algorithms are implemented.
