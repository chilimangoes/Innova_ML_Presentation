# Innova_ML_Presentation

Notes and resources for Machine Learning presentation given on 5/23

For those interested in learning more about machine learning, Gradon Faulkner has put together a great set of machine learning overviews and learning resources here: https://machine-learning-resources.gitbook.io/project/. He has grouped the resources into tracks catering to varying levels of interest, commitment, and background/experience. It includes everything from high-level infographics on what machine learning is, to guides for solving specific problems using various off-the-shelf ML frameworks, to college-level courses that dive into the nuts and bolts of how machine learning algorithms are implemented.

## Presentation Summary - What Is Machine Learning

Problems that are good opportunities for machine learning are typically:
1) Data driven
2) Difficult to codify into rules (i.e. require intuition or judgement)
3) But are tedious for a human to perform

What to look for - these kinds of questions are a tipoff that ML might be applicable to your problem:

* Can we answer this question automatically, based on some data?
* Can we automatically transform some input data into some output?
* Can we automatically associate thing A with thing B?
* Basically, if the question is "can we automatically do ______ based on some data?" then it might be a good candidate for machine learning
    * (Assuming, of course, that you have the data)

## On The Importance Of Product Design

From the Facebook Research [Field Guide to Machine Learning](https://research.fb.com/the-facebook-field-guide-to-machine-learning-video-series/), rigorously defining the problem you want to solve up front "can save many weeks work further downstream, preventing you from solving the wrong problem." You should try to clearly define what success looks like and how do you measure or quantify that success. This can be important aspect of software development in general, but it's even more important with machine learning because those measurements are literally what ML algorithms will be using to train their predictions. If you feed the wrong question into your ML algorithm, you're probably going to get the wrong answer.

The first video in the series, [Lesson 1: Problem definition (6 min)](https://research.fb.com/videos/field-guide-to-machine-learning-lesson-1-problem-definition/), is a good watch for product managers. And [the rest of the series](https://research.fb.com/the-facebook-field-guide-to-machine-learning-video-series/) is highly recommended for anyone technical on your teams that is interested in applying machine learning.
